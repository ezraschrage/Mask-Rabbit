### Description

MaskRabbit is a clone of the website TaskRabbit. A user will have the ability to create an account, create details for a task, and those criteria will be used to see if there are any available other users ("Maskers") who are willing to help them.

### Framework

MaskRabbit was built with the following technologies:
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL 12
- React
- Redux
- AWS image storage

### Features

MaskRabbit attempts to replicate the styling and layout of TaskRabbit wherever possible. This was accomplished using
the TaskRabbit logo as a template and finding icons that are similar to ones displayed on the page.
